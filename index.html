                                        <h3>Most heart and diabetic patients are treated by specialist doctors. They
                                             do not tempt in getting treatment from any doctor other than that specific
                                             doctor. Patients have to meet the doctor once in a certain period of time.
                                             With the busy schedule of doctors, patients should wait for a week to meet
                                             them. Most times, during this waiting period, the medicines need to control
                                             the condition of the patient may be over. This often prompts patients to
                                             take risky actions such as retaking previous medications. Because of this,
                                             the diabetics and heart risk conditions of the patients can become more
                                             serious. We are introducing this system in an effort to avoid this critical
                                             situation.

                                             As mentioned before guides on personal guidance systems for both heart and
                                             diabetes patients are rare. So, there should be a better solution for the
                                             personal guidance system for heart and diabetes patients. Both heart and
                                             cholesterol diseases can be managed by managing heart-healthy diets
                                             containing meal plans, managing stress, and day-to-day exercises.</h3>

                              <p>Several research have been conducted on the diagnosis for prevention of various
                                   diseases. The detection and prediction of heart and diabetes risk is an important
                                   issue. For this reason, this work has been
                                   prompted by a sizable amount of research on the use of machine learning algorithms
                                   for the diagnosis of heart and diabetes risk. Most of the work has been done in only

                                   risk. As an example, in this research <a

                                   challenging issue. There are a variety of characteristics that contribute to the
                                   prediction of
                                   diabetes and heart risk, but it is especially difficult to identify those features
                                   and make
                                   use of those characteristics to diagnose diabetes at an early stage. Thus, analyzing
                                   the
                                   qualities and attributes for prediction purposes is a complex process. Research has
                                   been
                                   happening during the previous many decades, and the problem is still accessible for
                                   research.
                                   After evaluating the study done by various contributors and researchers, it has been
                                   concluded that we cannot foresee which elements from the dataset have a significant
                                   function,
                                   and optimized feature selection cannot provide 100% accuracy. Machine learning
                                   classification
                                   techniques deployed by 99% of the researchers comprise naïve Bayes, support vector
                                   machine,
                                   decision trees, random forest, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and
                                   k-nearest neighbor.
                                   most of the products use manual input for attributes of those machine learning. But
                                   we cannot
                                   trust the user input. So, we are proposing a simple IoT device for collecting user
                                   health details.
                                   The device can measure users' common body health details (Heart Rate, Body
                                   Temperature) and send
                                   them to the mobile.<br />
                                   The above-mentioned literature survey clearly demonstrates the necessity for an early
                                   detection system that can identify both heart and
                                   diabetes because so little research has been focused on it based on trust user data.
                                   Today all mobile devices are equipped with health
                                   maintenance applications. As an example, Samsung has a 'Samsung Health' built-in
                                   mobile app. But those applications cannot predict Heart and
                                   Diabetics risks and cannot guide to control those. Via the proposed system, Users can
                                   Identify Heart and Diabetics risks by using gathered
                                   user data via the external device. In using this approach, the system can gather more
                                   trust data and users want to
                                   enter less number of data into the system. In the currently available mobile system,
                                   there is no adequate mechanism for
                                   predicting and controlling heart and diabetes. We have identified some similarities
                                   and differences. Those are the following<br />

                              The previous section has enough factorials to adequately explain and illustrate
                              what heart and diabetes issues are. If I go back, diabetes and heart disease are
                              among the top killers of people throughout the globe. The risk of diabetes and
                              heart disease is increased by a number of risk factors. One of the biggest risk
                              factors is obesity. Additionally, significant risk factors for heart disease include
                              blood pressure, diabetes, blood cholesterol levels, and body weight. All the above
                              triggers based on meals are very important point. People can avoid many of those
                              caused by controlling meals and pay elevated attention to meals. <br />
                              As predicted, 340 million children and teens aged 5 to 19 were overweight or
                              obese in 2016, and 38.2 million toddlers under the age of 5 were overweight or
                              obese. The expert guideline group on obesity found a strong direct correlation
                              between CVD risk and BMI. Additionally, they find that losing weight is
                              associated with improvements in CVD risk factors. The World Health Organization
                              (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Global Health Council,
                              and Partners in Health are just a few of the responsible organizations that regularly
                              publish articles, release news releases, and host events all over the world to promote
                              meal planning as a means of preventing diabetes and heart disease. In addition,
                              numerous scholars developed a wealth of fresh ideas, approaches, and expertise
                              as answers. Many of them are mostly worried about meal suggestions and unhealthful

                              Focusing on people with chronic renal disease is what Research A does. They
                              had not concentrated on both diabetes and cardiac patients, similar to Research
                              A. They have attempted to provide a better food recommendation based on
                              the potassium levels in the patients' blood using machine learning methods.
                              Researchers were worried about calories while conducting this study,
                              however they did not include the caloric content of the meals for the
                              patients in the final report. Additionally, Research B did not get any
                              customized food suggestions.<br />
                              Research B's primary interest has been with regard to meal suggestions
                              for diabetes individuals. Additionally, they used clustering analysis as
                              their study methodology. The crucial aspect of Research A is that patients
                              with diabetes are given particular consideration for this. For people
                              with diabetes, researchers have long sought to categorize the meal types.
                              Their study's concluding finding is individualized, great meal advice for
                              diabetics; however, heart sufferers were not included. Furthermore, they
                              had not given any thought to the caloric content of those meals in their
                              studies. <br />
                              A standardized approach for advice on daily food plans is presented in
                              Research C. Additionally, they have kept both user preferences and nutritional
                              information current. I was able to realize that they provided tailored food
                              suggestions up to a certain point after carefully reading Research C. But it
                              is more prone to generalization. They are worried about obese consumers in
                              certain instances. As a result, it has little to do with diabetics and
                              those with heart disease. Finally, Research C had offered participants
                              individualized dietary guidance based on their physical, physiological,
                              and other personal data.<br />
                              In Research D, the customer agreed to submit a sketch, photograph, or
                              other visual representation of a meal item. As a result, the number of
                              calories that appear in the uploaded meal picture will then be predicted.
                              It is a multi-tasking program that also displays weekly statistical data
                              on how many calories are consumed by the consumer and how many more or
                              less calories should be consumed to prevent illnesses associated to
                              obesity, such as heart attack and diabetes. Research E, however, is
                              also identical to Research A, B, and C. Those are unconcerned about
                              both cardiac and diabetes disease.<br />
                              Concerns concerning calories in any healthy diet plan were raised in
                              Research E. The major goal of the research was to develop a deep
                              learning-based method for calculating the calories of the food items
                              shown in the user's photograph. However, individuals with heart
                              disease and those with diabetes received less attention from researchers.<br />
                              Research F provides individualized meal suggestions, but it also disregards diabetics,
                              heart sufferers, and does not indicate calorie amount. Deep neural networks were
                              employed by the researchers as their approach. Using a temporal prediction model
                              on the profile and eating history, the model will forecast the subsequent dishes.
                              They paid little attention to the calories in the meals at any point in
                              the study. Overall, Research F is basically a method for making meal
                              recommendations. Patients with diabetes and heart disease are not its
                              main emphasis. In addition, Research F is a personalized food recommendation
                              system.<br />
                              As a result, it is very clear that there are no products that would provide better
                              individualized dietary recommendations for both diabetic patients and heart patients,
                              which specify the calorie amount.<br />
                              As a result, the suggested meal planner concept is built with many more functions
                              than other previous research that is now in use. By the suggested method, Meal
                              Planner would mostly provide healthy food options that are suitable for diabetics
                              and those with heart disease. Besides that, by using the system user can
                              get an idea about how much calorie amount they take in.<br />

                               According to the available research papers and resources, most of the existing systems 
                               provide a daily exercise plan for only heart patients and some of the systems provide 
                               exercise plans for only diabetic’s patients including those with health problem-related
                                to blood sugar levels, cholesterol level, and stress level (Table 1.2). Research A 
                                (Vinutha B Shetty, 2021)  has been concerned about their risk level and recommended 
                                exercise plan for diabetics’ patients where the authors have for use on blood 
                                glucose level which is effective to them during exercise and after exercise. It is 
                                based on a real-time support exercise plan for young people who are with TID 
                                during exercises, and research B (Yoke Yie Chen1, 2017)  has not concerned about 
                                risk level and it is for AI patients based on special socioeconomic, cultural,
                                 and geographical status. And research C (Dilith Sasanka) has concerned about
                                  risk levels and exercises for only heart patients. When focusing on exercise 
                                  the people have to be lazy keep their exercise regularly. And there is some 
                                  limit of exercise that assign to the real-time patients. Some existing systems 
                                  do not provide exact results according to duration, the volume of exercise, etc.
                                   Other systems provide exercise plans for specific individual age groups. 
                                   And there is no system to track previous exercises and recommended future 
                                   workout plans. According to this issue, the given system provides a manner 
                                   exercise plan for every risk level of both heart patient and diabetics patient.

                                   You need to learn to relax to cope with stress, especially if you 
                                   have heart disease and diabetes. Relaxation is a learned skill that 
                                   requires dedication and practice. The risk calculation procedure provides
                                    a wealth of information. Below are some of the most common sources of stress.
                                    <br />
                                    <ul>

                                        <li>Money troubles</li>

                                    <br />
                                    Once you find a relaxation technique that works for you, you can use it every 
                                    day. Taking the time to practice simple relaxation techniques will allow you 
                                    to relax and prepare for life's next challenge. There are several techniques
                                     for reducing stress levels in research papers. Most of them focus on basic 
                                     solutions.

                                         relief techniques, in research B the only part is to measure stress
                                          only, in research C they calculate stress levels using live data

                                   Most heart and diabetic patients are treated by specialist doctors. T
                                   hey do not tempt in getting treatment from any doctor other than that
                                   specific doctor. Patients have to meet the doctor once in a certain
                                   period of time. With the busy schedule of doctors, patients should
                                   wait for a week to meet them. Most times, during this waiting period,
                                   the medicines need to control the condition of the patient may be over.
                                   This often prompts patients to take risky actions such as retaking
                                   previous medications. Because of this, the diabetics and heart risk
                                   conditions of the patients can become more serious. We are
                                   introducing this system in an effort to avoid this critical situation.
                                   As mentioned before guides on personal guidance systems for both heart and
                                   diabetes patients are rare. So, there should be a better solution for the
                                   personal guidance system for heart and diabetes patients. Both heart and
                                   cholesterol diseases can be prevented by managing heart-healthy diets
                                   containing meal plans, managing stress, and day-to-day exercises.

                                   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting
                                   for 16% of all fatalities. Because of this, passing has increased significantly
                                   since 2000, rising by more than 2 million to 8.9 million passing in 2019. In 2014,
                                   8.5% of persons who were 18 or older had diabetes. A total of 1.5 million deaths
                                   were directly related to diabetes in 2019, and 48% of these deaths occurred in
                                   people under the age of 70. Diabetes patients frequently develop heart problems.
                                   According to National Cardiac Association data from 2012, 65% of diabetics will
                                   pass away from a heart condition or a stroke. People with diabetes are more
                                   than twice as likely to die from heart disease and stroke. A person's
                                   risk for heart disease and diabetes can also be increased by a number
                                   of other medical issues and lifestyle choices, including sedentary lifestyles,
                                   fast-food habits, obesity, overweight, and bad diets.
                                   In impoverished nations like Sri Lanka, where there is a dearth of medical
                                   diagnostic equipment and specialists, heart disease diagnosis and treatment
                                   are particularly difficult. So, for a diabetic and a heart patient, a realistic
                                   and accurate risk prediction of diabetic diseases, heart-related diseases, and
                                   guidance for maintaining a healthy life are important. According to the survey,
                                   many individuals are aware of heart disease and diabetes, but the majority of
                                   them are unaware that the number of people dying from both of these conditions
                                   is rising daily.
                                   Therefore, changes in the world's food system, dietary habits, and potential
                                   governmental responses have a negative impact on leading a healthy life.
                                   Therefore, the food system would have more potent motivating incentives to
                                   deliver greater advantages for them if more individuals made better choices.
                                   People are also aware that eating poorly, consuming unhealthy fats, and consuming
                                   processed meats can increase their susceptibility to a number of diseases. The
                                   survey's findings indicate that people are aware that improper eating habits can
                                   lead to both heart disease and diabetes, and that a good diet can reduce the risk
                                   of both conditions. As a result, a lot of them employ personal trainers or schedule t
                                   heir workouts in gyms. Even so, since they might not be able to pay personal trainers
                                   or fitness sessions but still want to adhere to good diet plans, some people need to
                                   keep track of their meals. However, the issue is that, despite people's best efforts
                                   to eat healthily, there is no such personal guidance for leading a healthy life that
                                   provides daily recommendations for healthy meals. As a result, many people believe
                                   that
                                   managing their hectic lifestyles will be made easier by following the advice provided

                                   NCD are long-term illnesses caused by a mix of genetic, physiological, environmental,
                                   and behavioral factors. Because of this 41million people die each year. And also
                                   15 million people who are in-between the age of 30 and 69 years die because of NCD.
                                   According to WHO recordings they estimated 17.9 million people were dying of
                                   cardiovascular diseases and 1.5 million people were dying of diabetics
                                   (Noncommunicable diseases, n.d.). During the 40 years, Sri Lanka has been the
                                   leading cause of death in heart diseases and diabetics. It is increased by 3% in
                                   1945 t0 24% by 2018. According to a national representative study in Sri Lanka,
                                   the mean age of heart diseases victim was 58.2 years, and the highest number of
                                   male patients was 61.8%. The reasons for that increased NCD are physical inactivity
                                   unhealthy diets, and harmful use of alcohol (Physical activity, n.d.).
                                   Nowadays people live a very complicated and busy life. Low of people are doing

                                   control their condition by doing exercise. But their risk level, how they clarify

                                   risk of this disease. Most of the patients have been treated for heart diseases and

                                   The problem is there are no facilities to monitor the patient every day in all cases
                                   accurately and consultation of the patient for 24 hours. In developed countries like
                                   Sri Lanka, it is very difficult to identify the diagnosis and cure of heart disease
                                   and diabetes early. So that reasonable and accurate risk prediction must have a

                                   Stress management is an integral part of everyday life. Stress can affect every part
                                   of your life, including your ability to think, behave, and stay healthy. Stress can
                                   be caused by physical factors such as lack of sleep or illness. Emotional stress,
                                   such as not having enough money or worrying about the death of a loved one, is
                                   another source of anxiety.
                                   Stress can also come from less dramatic causes, such as pressure from regular
                                   commitments and feeling powerless. This type of behavior can lead to a heart attack
                                   or diabetes [12]. We can see that people respond to stressful situations differently
                                   if we go deeper into these topics. Some people have strong reactions to certain
                                   situations. Others are calm and unconcerned.

                              It should prioritize nutrition for people with diabetes and heart disease. People are
                              unable to eat anything they want after developing heart disease or diabetes. They should
                              thus pay close attention to their nutrition programs. Individuals need proper guidance on
                              which foods are good for a diet and which foods are bad for their health as a consequence.
                              Additionally, data about the patient is gathered at the beginning of the process and
                              utilized to assess the patient's level of risk. Then, suggest meals for the patient based
                              on the findings and after considering their preferences. It helps control the amount of
                              unhealthy food patients eat.
                              In order to provide patients with meals that are appropriate for their medical conditions,
                              this is the goal.
                              The number of calories in each type of meal varies. Calories consumed by humans are
                              absorbed by the body. Despite the fact that the body needs calories to produce energy,
                              consuming too much can be harmful. In addition, a lot of individuals are ignorant of how
                              many calories their bodies actually burn. It might be for a number of reasons. For
                              instance, some people forget to count their calories while they eat, while others have
                              little interest in doing so. However, they didn't realize they were consuming a lot of
                              calories. In the end, they are unaware of the number of calories their bodies are
                              ingesting through meals. The focus is then taken away from what they should be doing,
                              which is burning those calories.
                              When the contemporary era comes along, the world becomes very competitive, and as a
                              result, individuals lead challenging lives that are full of stress. As I mentioned before,

                                   Most heart and diabetic patients are treated by specialist doctors. They do not tempt in getting treatment 
                                   from any doctor other than that specific doctor. Patients have to meet the doctor once in a certain period 
                                   of time. With the busy schedule of doctors, patients should wait for a week to meet them. Most times, during 
                                   this waiting period, the medicines need to control the condition of the patient may be over. This often prompts
                                    patients to take risky actions such as retaking previous medications. Because of this, the diabetics and heart 
                                    risk conditions of the patients can become more serious. We are introducing this system in an effort to avoid 
                                    this critical situation.

                                   As mentioned before guides on personal guidance systems for both heart and diabetes patients are rare. So, there 
                                   should be a better solution for the personal guidance system for heart and diabetes patients. Both heart and 
                                   cholesterol diseases can be managed by managing heart-healthy diets containing meal plans, managing stress, 
                                   and day-to-day exercises.

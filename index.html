                                                  With the busy schedule of doctors, patients should wait for a week to meet

                                   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting 
                                   for 16% of all fatalities. Because of this, passing has increased significantly
                                    since 2000, rising by more than 2 million to 8.9 million passing in 2019. In 2014,
                                     8.5% of persons who were 18 or older had diabetes. A total of 1.5 million deaths 
                                     were directly related to diabetes in 2019, and 48% of these deaths occurred in 
                                     people under the age of 70. Diabetes patients frequently develop heart problems.
                                      According to National Cardiac Association data from 2012, 65% of diabetics will
                                       pass away from a heart condition or a stroke. People with diabetes are more
                                        than twice as likely to die from heart disease and stroke. A person's 
                                        risk for heart disease and diabetes can also be increased by a number
                                         of other medical issues and lifestyle choices, including sedentary lifestyles, 
                                         fast-food habits, obesity, overweight, and bad diets.
                                   In impoverished nations like Sri Lanka, where there is a dearth of medical 
                                   diagnostic equipment and specialists, heart disease diagnosis and treatment 
                                   are particularly difficult. So, for a diabetic and a heart patient, a realistic
                                    and accurate risk prediction of diabetic diseases, heart-related diseases, and 
                                    guidance for maintaining a healthy life are important. According to the survey, 
                                    many individuals are aware of heart disease and diabetes, but the majority of 
                                    them are unaware that the number of people dying from both of these conditions
                                     is rising daily.
                                   Therefore, changes in the world's food system, dietary habits, and potential
                                    governmental responses have a negative impact on leading a healthy life.
                                     Therefore, the food system would have more potent motivating incentives to 
                                     deliver greater advantages for them if more individuals made better choices.
                                      People are also aware that eating poorly, consuming unhealthy fats, and consuming 
                                      processed meats can increase their susceptibility to a number of diseases. The 
                                      survey's findings indicate that people are aware that improper eating habits can 
                                      lead to both heart disease and diabetes, and that a good diet can reduce the risk 
                                      of both conditions. As a result, a lot of them employ personal trainers or schedule t
                                      heir workouts in gyms. Even so, since they might not be able to pay personal trainers 
                                      or fitness sessions but still want to adhere to good diet plans, some people need to 
                                      keep track of their meals. However, the issue is that, despite people's best efforts 
                                      to eat healthily, there is no such personal guidance for leading a healthy life that 
                                      provides daily recommendations for healthy meals. As a result, many people believe that

                                   NCD are long-term illnesses caused by a mix of genetic, physiological, environmental, 
                                   and behavioral factors. Because of this 41million people die each year. And also 
                                   15 million people who are in-between the age of 30 and 69 years die because of NCD.
                                    According to WHO recordings they estimated 17.9 million people were dying of 
                                    cardiovascular diseases and 1.5 million people were dying of diabetics 
                                    (Noncommunicable diseases, n.d.). During the 40 years, Sri Lanka has been the 
                                    leading cause of death in heart diseases and diabetics. It is increased by 3% in 
                                    1945 t0 24% by 2018. According to a national representative study in Sri Lanka, 
                                    the mean age of heart diseases victim was 58.2 years, and the highest number of 
                                    male patients was 61.8%. The reasons for that increased NCD are physical inactivity 
                                    unhealthy diets, and harmful use of alcohol (Physical activity, n.d.).
                                   Nowadays people live a very complicated and busy life. Low of people are doing

                                   If the patient is suffering from both heart diseases and diabetes and they need to 
                                   control their condition by doing exercise. But their risk level, how they clarify

                                    and diabetes. So, it is very important to have good regular exercise to decrease the 
                                    risk of this disease. Most of the patients have been treated for heart diseases and 
                                    diabetes. But American diabetes and cardiovascular association showed that small 
                                    physical activity can happen a lot of changes in an unhealthy body.
                                   The problem is there are no facilities to monitor the patient every day in all cases 
                                   accurately and consultation of the patient for 24 hours. In developed countries like 
                                   Sri Lanka, it is very difficult to identify the diagnosis and cure of heart disease 
                                   and diabetes early. So that reasonable and accurate risk prediction must have a proper
                                    guideline of exercise for both diseases.

                                   Stress management is an integral part of everyday life. Stress can affect every part of your life, including your ability to think, behave, and stay healthy. Stress can be caused by physical factors such as lack of sleep or illness. Emotional stress, such as not having enough money or worrying about the death of a loved one, is another source of anxiety.
                                   Stress can also come from less dramatic causes, such as pressure from regular commitments and feeling powerless. This type of behavior can lead to a heart attack or diabetes [12]. We can see that people respond to stressful situations differently if we go deeper into these topics. Some people have strong reactions to certain situations. Others are calm and unconcerned.

Once we are aware of the individual objectives, realizing the main goal is simple. It will progressively be possible to accomplish the main goal by setting specific goals and attaining them. The following are the exact goals that must be met as a result:

                                   It should prioritize nutrition for people with diabetes and heart disease. People are unable to eat anything they want after developing heart disease or diabetes. They should thus pay close attention to their nutrition programs. Individuals need proper guidance on which foods are good for a diet and which foods are bad for their health as a consequence. Additionally, data about the patient is gathered at the beginning of the process and utilized to assess the patient's level of risk. Then, suggest meals for the patient based on the findings and after considering their preferences. It helps control the amount of unhealthy food patients eat.
                                   In order to provide patients with meals that are appropriate for their medical conditions, this is the goal.
                                   The number of calories in each type of meal varies. Calories consumed by humans are absorbed by the body. Despite the fact that the body needs calories to produce energy, consuming too much can be harmful. In addition, a lot of individuals are ignorant of how many calories their bodies actually burn. It might be for a number of reasons. For instance, some people forget to count their calories while they eat, while others have little interest in doing so. However, they didn't realize they were consuming a lot of calories. In the end, they are unaware of the number of calories their bodies are ingesting through meals. The focus is then taken away from what they should be doing, which is burning those calories.
                                   When the contemporary era comes along, the world becomes very competitive, and as a result, individuals lead challenging lives that are full of stress. As I mentioned before, people always try to achieve their goals through efficient competition. Many people haven't thought about their health in these situations. After all, this is a significant problem. The body's organs need strength to function properly. The body's organs need strength to function properly. Nutritious meals must be taken at the right times to sustain strength.

                                   Most heart and diabetic patients are treated by specialist doctors. They do not tempt in getting treatment 
                                   from any doctor other than that specific doctor. Patients have to meet the doctor once in a certain period 
                                   of time. With the busy schedule of doctors, patients should wait for a week to meet them. Most times, during 
                                   this waiting period, the medicines need to control the condition of the patient may be over. This often prompts
                                    patients to take risky actions such as retaking previous medications. Because of this, the diabetics and heart 
                                    risk conditions of the patients can become more serious. We are introducing this system in an effort to avoid 
                                    this critical situation.

                                   As mentioned before guides on personal guidance systems for both heart and diabetes patients are rare. So, there 
                                   should be a better solution for the personal guidance system for heart and diabetes patients. Both heart and 
                                   cholesterol diseases can be managed by managing heart-healthy diets containing meal plans, managing stress, 
                                   and day-to-day exercises.
